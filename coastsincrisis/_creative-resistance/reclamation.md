The title of Sally Binard's "Reclamation" refers to both the salvage of physical debris after Hurricane Irma, and to the reclamation and transformation of her artistic practice. Binard observes that after the storm, her work became less about abstract aesthetics and more about narrating the physical process of building things. Part of her artistic reclamation process was her increased willingness to push her own creative boundaries: "When you have seen most of your possessions and your home submerged or swept or blown away, you realize that metaphorically your slate can be wiped clean at any time. Taking risks with your art seems less risky, and it becomes important to take those risks as an artist."
