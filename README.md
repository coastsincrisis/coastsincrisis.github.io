# coastsincrisis.github.io
This is the site repository for _Coasts in Crisis_, a digital art exhibit that features pieces produced during the 2017 hurricane season in the Caribbean islands of St. Croix, the Florida Keys, and Puerto Rico.

It's currently under production. We're migrating the project from Drupal 9, still reachable at coastsincrisis.net.


### issues
1. `--livereload` 2023-06-25. There's something in my computer that's not allowing the plugin to work. I tried editing the _config.yml, the gemfile, reinstalling ruby in a conda environment, as well as jekyll and other gem files. Several attempts at troubleshooting why the auto regeneration wasn't working also proved unsuccessful, but using `--force_polling` instead.
