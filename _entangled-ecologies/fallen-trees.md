The morning after Hurricane María passed through Puerto Rico, the composer and pianist Alfonso Fuentes noticed that the coquí frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui) had stopped singing. When Fuentes emerged from his home, he was devastated by the quantity of fallen trees, many of them indigenous species that had survived for centuries. Moved by the visual and aural destruction of Puerto Rico's ecology, Fuentes immediately began composing the work that would become his "Oda a los árboles caídos" ("Ode to the Fallen Trees").  

In an interview, Fuentes emphasized that his work for piano and clarinet is dedicated specifically to the trees themselves. His composition reminds us of the intertwined essence, fates, futures, of human and nonhuman ecologies.
