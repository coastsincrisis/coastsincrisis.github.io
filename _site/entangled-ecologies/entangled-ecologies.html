<p>The St. Lucian poet and Nobel Prize winner Derek Walcott writes that Caribbean history “is there in Antillean geography, in the vegetation itself.”1</p>

<p>In this pathway, artists, musicians, and poets tell the history of Hurricane María through the transformation of the island’s trees.</p>

<p>These trees bear witness to and share in the story of its people: both are a mix of indigenous and transplanted varieties, many felled by the storm, some uprooted, still more learning to flourish in the spaces where others have fallen.</p>

<p>Part elegy, part celebration of regrowth, these works reveal to us that the lives and landscapes of Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and beyond are deeply and beautifully entangled.</p>
