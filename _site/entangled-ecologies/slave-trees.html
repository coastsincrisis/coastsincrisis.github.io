<p>St. Croix photographer David Berg was struck by the power of Hurricane María to bring down what islanders in St. Croix call “Slave Trees.” Pictured here is a ceiba tree dating from the era of slavery, which was abolished following a revolt of enslaved peoples in St. Croix in 1848.</p>

<p>The title of Berg’s photographic series “Regrowth” points to the long memories of human and more-than-human ecologies and their resurgence in the aftermath of hurricanes.</p>
