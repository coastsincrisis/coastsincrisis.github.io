<p>“Under Pressure” reframes our concept of landscape and sense of place. Following Hurricane María, Sarabel Santos-Negrón discovered that in order to navigate the debris left behind, she had to walk while looking down. She began photographing the ground beneath her feet and later created tiles based on these photographs.</p>

<p>In its installation at “Coasts in Crisis,” visitors to the exhibition walked on the tiles while the sound piece, “Under Pressure,” played on speakers around them.  The effect gives the visitor a visual and auditory experience of what living through a hurricane and its aftermath feels like.</p>
