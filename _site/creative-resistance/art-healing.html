<p>Hurricane Irma destroyed Florida Keys-based artist Sally Binard’s home in 2017. After the storm, she saw how “everything that was on the inside of a person’s home was on the outside…and everything that was in the inside of a person was was also on the outside.” Her self-portrait “Afraid to Launch,” made out of found materials she salvaged from the wreckage of her home, evokes that sense of upheaval. The nails surrounding the artist’s face show the inherent physicality as well as the artistic creativity required to rebuild after a storm.</p>
